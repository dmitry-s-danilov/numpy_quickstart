# [NumPy Quickstart tutorial][tutorial]

## Prerequisites

#### Learner profile

This tutorial is intended as
a quick overview of algebra and arrays in NumPy
and want to understand how
n-dimensional (n>=2) arrays are represented and can be manipulated.

#### Learning Objectives

- Understand the difference between
one-, two- and n-dimensional arrays in NumPy;
- Understand how to apply some linear algebra operations
to n-dimensional arrays without using for-loops;
- Understand axis and shape properties for n-dimensional arrays.
